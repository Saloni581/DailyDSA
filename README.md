# Daily DSA Practice

This repository contains my daily Data Structures & Algorithms practice.

- Problems solved consistently and pushed day-by-day  
- Focus on core concepts, clean logic, and correctness  
- Language: JAVA (primary), C++

This repo is meant for discipline, revision, and long-term improvement and not for polished solutions.
